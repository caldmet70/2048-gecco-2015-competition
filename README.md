2048 Controller Competition @ GECCO 2015
========================================
This code requires Java 8.

Building
--------
You do need to build the code. Just download the prebuild [2048.jar](https://github.com/wjaskowski/2048-gecco-2015-competition/releases/tag/1.0)

If you want to build it yourself, you need Maven. Just execute:

```bash
> mvn package
```

Preparing your agent
--------------------
A simple examplary controller (MyTeamAgent.java):
```java
import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Random;
import put.game2048.*;

import org.apache.commons.math3.random.MersenneTwister;
import org.apache.commons.math3.random.RandomDataGenerator;

class MyTeamAgent implements Agent {
	public Random random = new Random(123);

	public Action chooseAction(Board board, List<Action> possibleActions, Duration maxTime) {
	    if (possibleActions.contains(Action.UP)) {
	        return Action.UP;
        } else {
            return possibleActions.get(random.nextInt(possibleActions.size()));
        }
	}

    // A similar main() will be used by the organizers to evaluate your agent
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final Duration ACTION_TIME_LIMIT = Duration.ofMillis(1);
        final int NUM_GAMES = 1000;

        RandomDataGenerator random = new RandomDataGenerator(new MersenneTwister(123));
		MultipleGamesResult result = new Game(ACTION_TIME_LIMIT).playMultiple(MyAgent::new, NUM_GAMES, random);
		System.out.println(result.toCvsRow());
    }
```

To compile the agent:
```bash
> javac -cp 2048.jar MyAgent.java
```

To run the agent: 
```bash
> java -cp .:2048.jar MyAgent
MeanScore,95IntervalScore,MaxScore,AvgActionTime[ms],16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048,4096,8912,16384,32768,65536
1305.3,13.1,5356.0,0.000,1.000,0.995,0.929,0.614,0.135,0.001,0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000
```

The values at the end of the row are the percentages of games in which the controller achieved a tile of a given value.
