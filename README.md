Building
--------
You need Java 1.8 and Maven. To build execute:

mvn package

Coding your agent
-----------------

import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Random;
import put.game2048.*;

import org.apache.commons.math3.random.MersenneTwister;
import org.apache.commons.math3.random.RandomDataGenerator;

class MyAgent implements Agent {
	public Random random = new Random(123);

	public Action chooseAction(Board board, List<Action> possibleActions, Duration maxTime) {
	    if (possibleActions.contains(Action.UP)) {
	        return Action.UP;
        } else {
            return possibleActions.get(random.nextInt(possibleActions.size()));
        }
	}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final Duration ACTION_TIME_LIMIT = Duration.ofMillis(1);
        final int NUM_GAMES = 10000;

        RandomDataGenerator random = new RandomDataGenerator(new MersenneTwister(123));
		MultipleGamesResult result = new Game(ACTION_TIME_LIMIT).playMultiple(MyAgent::new, NUM_GAMES, random);
		System.out.println(result.toCvsRow());
    }
